# Weave Strands

A personal take on video game engine design and implementation where the wheel is reinvented every time it turns.

This is yet another turning with a clear objective: providing related but fully independent implementations of various game engine elements and systems.

## Author notes
Hi!
You're looking at Weave's repository, a one-man project that implements many modules, systems, utilities and pieces of an ever changing game engine. I made this as a way to explore video game tech and experiment with it without being limited to comercial, private or enterprise interests.

It's all mostly written in C++, with the newer code pieces focusing on *C++20*. However, not all the code base is updated to newer standard practices; there's some really old code pieces lurking in this repository! Weave uses very few external libraries, which means many things that probably shouldn't be written for the Nth time have been written regardless. 

The repository includes a crude CMake based project which will generate static libraries separated in mostly independent modules.

Despite this being experimental grounds, a few iterations of Weave has been tried and tested in comercially available games for PC (Steam), PS4 and Switch.

## Mission
Weave is intended to be a general purpose, multi platform, game engine with a relatively unintrusive design - it provides some of the pieces needed to make a game but doesn't necessarily create an on-rails framework. Instead, as with any other library, the developer is meant to build on top of it.

Strands is the newest turn of the project which focuses on breaking all system dependencies, allowing smaller pieces of the engine to be integrated individually.

## What this is _not_
This repo doesn't contain a full product. It contains parts that I can show to the public because they don't include code from other authors or platforms with proprietary code. Some pieces are simply missing altogether because of licensing limitations that should be respected.
